# Snap
A Ruby sandbox inspired by Logo and Scratch.

What is Snap? Snap is similar to Logo and Scratch, sharing the same goals of creating a world where kids can play and, hopefully, learn something (shhh, don't tell them!).

Why yet another tool when there are things out there already?

Well, the world has moved on since 1967 (when Logo was created) and our tools and systems have changed too. We want to do more, sooner and better than we did 50 years ago.

While Logo was created for kids to play with words and sentences in a mathematical world (more on that below), Snap's goal is a little, different. Kids should still have fun and play with stuff (because kids are kids and anything that ain't fun ain't worth doing, right?) but and this is a big but, they'll learn to code in Ruby by accident ;-)
## Logo's creation
Logo was created in 1967 with the goal of letting kids play with words and sentences in a mathematical land.
